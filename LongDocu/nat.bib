abstract = {The Technical University of Lisbon (UTL) is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Being a jubilee occasion a full program of events took place, including a two day Symposium on the research at UTL. This Symposium addressed the state-of-art in major areas of excellence at UTL. This book, containing the edited version of the invited lectures, brings together in a review manner a comprehensive summary of high quality research contributions across basic and applied sciences. As a result a broad spectrum of topics is covered reflecting the areas at UTL where there is a worldwide recognition of expertise. The transdisciplinary nature of most areas aims to stress a sense of purpose in the work developed. The contributing papers are organized around the following major areas: Emergent areas (Nanosciences, Quantic Computations and Information, Smart Materials, Risk and Volatility in financial markets); Basic Sciences (Math, Physics, Chemistry, Materials); Social Sciences, Economics and Management Sciences; Life and Biotechnology Engineering; Public Health and Food Quality and Safety; Nature, Environment and Sustainability; Health and Sport sciences; Architecture, Urbanism, Arts and Design},

@book{Robertson2009_cardiovascular,
abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases have a major impact in Western countries. Mathematical models and numerical simulations can help the understanding of physiological and pathological processes, complementing the information provided to medical doctors by medical imaging and other non-invasive means, and opening the possibility of a better diagnosis and more in-depth surgical planning. This book offers a mathematically sound and up-to-date foundation to the training of researchers, and serves as a useful reference for the development of mathematical models and numerical simulation codes. It is structured into different chapters, written by recognized experts in the field, and however it features a common thread, with consistency of notation and expressions and systematic cross-referencing. Many fundamental issues are faced, such as: the mathematical representation of vascular geometries extracted from medical images, modelling blood rheology and the complex multilayer structure of the vascular tissue, and its possible pathologies, the mechanical and chemical interaction between blood and vascular walls; the different scales coupling local and systemic dynamics. All of these topics introduce challenging mathematical and numerical problems, demanding for advanced analysis and simulation techniques. This book is addressed to graduate students and researchers in the field of bioengineering, applied mathematics and medicine, wishing to engage themselves in the fascinating task of modeling how the cardiovascular system works. Physiology and pathology of the cardiovascular system: A physical perspective -- Basic mathematical models and motivations -- The derivation of the equations for fluids and structure -- From image data to computational domains -- Geometry and flow -- Rheological models for blood -- Mathematical models of mass transfer in the vascular walls -- Analysis of coupled models for fluid-structure interaction of internal flows -- Algorithms for fluid-structure interaction problems -- Reduced models of the cardiovascular system -- Multiscale models of the vascular system -- Applications and test cases.},

@article{Bessonov2016_MethodsBloodFlow,
abstract = {This review is devoted to recent developments in blood flow modelling. It begins with the discussion of blood rheology and its non-Newtonian properties. After that we will present some modelling methods where blood is considered as a heterogeneous fluid composed of plasma and blood cells. Namely, we will describe the method of Dissipative Particle Dynamics and will present some results of blood flow modelling. The last part of this paper deals with one-dimensional global models of blood circulation. We will explain the main ideas of this approach and will present some examples of its application.},
